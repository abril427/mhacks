      Dorothy, Toto, and Scarecrow met Tin Man as they continued down the yellow brick road. Tin Man was so rusted that he couldn&#39;t move! &#34;We need to get you some motors,&#34; said Dorothy. (Do you know what a motor is?) (linked text button to video)
Which part of a motor slows down the rotations?
a) electric current   b) gear box c) axle shaft
Great job! Now Tin Man can move. He is so grateful to Dorothy the great engineer! He wants to bend down and pick her a flower, but is not built to do that. How can we alter Tin Man&#39;s design so that he can show his gratitude?
